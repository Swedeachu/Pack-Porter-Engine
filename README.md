# Pack-Porter-Engine
The engine of the pack porter
<br>
Will be updated a lot to work with the porter site Polr and I are creating.
# To do
Sky commands (very easy)
<br>
MCPE to Java (old version was scuffed so going to implement a new version of it later)
<br>
Latest version of Java to MCPE (1.12+ crystal pvp packs specfically)
<br>
MCPE to latest version of java (low priority)
<br>
Zombie and sheep entity conversions
<br>
Verifying that inventory bug scaling is fixed
<br>
fixing hotbar slot selector transparency if possible
<br>
add this porter engine to a sleak and fancy 3.0 desktop application that will have all these features

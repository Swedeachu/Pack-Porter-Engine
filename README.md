# Pack-Porter-Engine
The engine of the pack porter
<br>
Will be updated a lot to work with the porter site Polr and I are creating.
# How to use
This is a CLI application
<br>
Accepts Port Commands for mediafire, pvprp, and file paths. 
<br>
Example:
<br>
java - jar PorterEngine-all.jar port "mediafire.com/pack.zip"
<br>
java - jar PorterEngine-all.jar port "C:\file.zip"
<br>
The program returns a hashcode of the string to the file path returned after porting is complete
# Requires Java
[Download it here](https://download.oracle.com/java/17/archive/jdk-17.0.5_windows-x64_bin.exe)
# To do
Sky commands (very easy)
<br>
MCPE to Java (old version was scuffed so going to implement a new version of it later)
<br>
Latest version of Java to MCPE (1.12+ crystal pvp packs specfically)
<br>
MCPE to latest version of java (low priority)
<br>
Zombie and sheep entity conversions
<br>
Verifying that inventory bug scaling is fixed
<br>
fixing hotbar slot selector transparency if possible
<br>
add this porter engine to a sleak and fancy 3.0 desktop application that will have all these features
